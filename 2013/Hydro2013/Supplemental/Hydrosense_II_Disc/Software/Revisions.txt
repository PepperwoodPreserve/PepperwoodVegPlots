v1.0.8.216 : Released 3 July 2012

 - Added a warning message to the Operating System Updater to warn the user that 
   sending an operating system to the HydroSense II will remove all measurements and
   zones from the device.

v1.0.8.215

 - The maximum length of zone names has been reduced to 14 characters. This is to fix 
   an issue where the software was allowing zone names of 15 characters, while the 
   HydroSense II only allows zone names of 14 characters.

v1.0.8.214

 - Fixed an issue where the Zone Settings window would not be drawn completely on 
   Windows systems with a DPI different to 96.

 - Fixed an issue where changes to zone settings in the Map View would not update the 
   Zone Name column in the Data View immediately.

 - The timeline chart below the Data View and Chart View will now update to reflect 
   changes in the currently selected zones. Points from unselected zones will not be 
   shown in the timeline.


v1.0.8.212

 - The user can now right click on a measurement point in the Map View and choose 
   "Find in Data View". This wil display the Data View select the row for the chosen 
   point.

 - The user can now right click on one or more rows in the Data View and choose "Find 
   in Map View". This will display the Map View and highlight the chosen points.

 - Fixed a typo where the edit zone dialog would inform the user that the zone size 
   should be larger than 3m. This now reads "larger than or equal to 3m".

 - Improved layout code for the Map View. Point positions are now more precise and 
   will not "jitter" when zooming in.

 - Added a zoom in / zoom out control to the Map View. The Map View can now be scaled 
   using the mousewheel, zoom in / zoom out buttons or a slider for finer scale 
   control.

 - Added the current view area in meters to the bottom of the Map View.

 - The Main Window now saves its screen position, active monitor and size when 
   closing. 

 - Fixed an issue where on certain installations the height of the Main Window would 
   grow with each software restart.

 - New zones can now be created from the Map View. The user can right click an 
   existing point or empty position on the Map Canvas and choose "Create New Zone".

 - Zones are now listed alphabetically in the Zones drop down box above the Data, 
   Chart and Map Views.


v1.0.8.208

 - Changed the Edit Zone Settings dialog to restrict input of invalid settings:
    o The zone name cannot be empty
    o The zone name cannot match an existing zone name
    o The zone radius must be a valid decimal number
    o The zone radius must be greater than or equal to 3 meters

 - Fixed a bug where a zone could be given a zero radius using the Edit Zone Settings 
   dialog and hence not be displayed on the Map View.

   After setting a zero radius for the zone, double clicking on the zone in the Zones 
   List would cause a software crash. This meant that the zone radius could not be 
   changed back to the previous value.

   The software will now change all zero radius zones to 3 meter radius zones on a 
   software restart making them available for editing on the Map View.

v1.0.7.206 : Released 4 January 2012

 - The user will now be prompted to immediately perform a synchronise after a firmware 
   upgrade so that zones saved to the PC can be uploaded to the HydroSense II. The 
   zones table on the HydroSense II will have been cleared during the firmware upgrade.

 - Removed the option to install for all users from the windows installer package.
   Previously having the option to install for all users or for the current user could 
   result in duplicate short cut and uninstall entries.


v1.0.7.205

 - Improved code added to 1.0.6.202 to better detect devices running firmware version
   v1.02 which have stored 1000+ points, thus causing a connection or synchronise 
   failure.

 - Fixed a rare issue where unchecking the "Select all Dates" checkbox could cause an 
   application hang. 


______________________________________________________________________________________

v1.0.6.202 : Released 14 December 2011

 - Added code to handle a known issue with HydroSense II firmware v1.02. When more 
   than 1000 points are stored on a device running v1.02 firmware, the software is 
   unable to retrieve table information from the device. Previously this resulted in 
   a connection failure, now the software will connect and warn the user that
   synchronising will re-download all data from the device and overwrite any local
   zone changes with the zone information store on the device. See the help file
   for more information.

 - Fixed a typo in the Synchronise toolbar; the zones row would display 
   "New zones to upload" when both device and PC zones had changed. This is incorrect 
   and has been changed to "New zones to download".

 - Now displaying transfer progress in the main window status bar during a synchronise
   including an estimated transfer time.

 - Fixed an issue where reducing a timeline selection to the width required to zoom 
   in would force an immediate zoom in. This version now waits until the mouse button 
   is released to zoom in.

 - Fixed an issue where maximising the main window, then closing the application would 
   cause the main window to resize to the screen resolution on startup without 
   maximising. This version now only remembers the window size while not maximised.

 - Help changes:
       - Added the Bluetooth pairing code the Getting Started Guide.
       - Added descriptions for all measurement columns to the Data View section.
       - Added NoTableInfo error code section.

v1.0.5.194 : Released 23 November 2011

 - Fixed an issue where collecting less than three minutes of data on the very first 
   collection could cause the selected length of time in the timeline chart to be too 
   small to move if the second data collection is more than 1 hour later.

 - Fixed a typo where an extra closing bracket was being displayed behind timestamps
   in the timeline chart when the chart was showing 1 day of data.

v1.0.5.193

 - Added the Bluetooth Pairing Code for the HydroSense II to the Getting Started Guide
   in the help file.

v1.0.5.192

 - Fixed an issue where device operating system version 1.0.2 can possibly cause 
   connection with the software to fail with a BTUnknownError.

 - Fixed an issue where the Zones menu would be hidden in the Chart View after 
   deselecting Show All Zones.

 - Now displaying the build number in the software version at the bottom right of the 
   main window.

______________________________________________________________________________________

v1.0.4.191 : Released 21 November 2011

 - Removed the Temperature and EC (Electrical Conductivity) columns from the Data View 
   and CSV export. The Temperature and EC measurements supplied by the sensor are not 
   intended for use in the HydroSense II system. These values will not be accurate 
   unless the sensor is fixed in place under the soil for a considerable amount of 
   time (hours), which is only feasible when using the sensor with a datalogger.

 - Added a Help page for the Log Files introduced in 1.0.3.185.

 - Changed images in the Help file which still show the text "Data is synchronised".

______________________________________________________________________________________

v1.0.3.187 : Released 18 November 2011

 - The following windows are now displayed with a fixed size (instead of auto-sizing 
   to fit all controls). Previously these windows would be partially drawn on displays
   using a DPI other than 96.

	- Device Settings Window
	- Device Time Window
	- Reading Colours Window


v1.0.3.186

 - Fixed an issue which causes an unhandled exception on startup when running  
   v1.0.3.185 in Windows XP

 - Changed text on the toolbar from "Data is synchronised" to "Data are synchronised".

 - Now fitting the Map View to zones as well as measurements after pressing the Zoom to 
   Extents button.

 - Fixed an issue where the Map View would not correctly zoom to fit all zones and 
   measurements on startup.


v1.0.3.185

 - Fixed an issue where a remote device may not be discovered on the first ever 
   discovery attempt.

 - Fixed an issue where storing exactly one record on the device would cause an 
   application crash directly after synchronising and subsequently on each software 
   restart.

 - Fixed an issue where writing an export file (KML, GPX, PNG, JPG, BMP or CSV) to an 
   existing file which is currently in use would cause an application crash.

 - Fixed an issue in the Operating System Updater where the device list was not being 
   remembered between sessions.

 - The Operating System Updater now parses all .a43 files before sending to the device.
   Any errors in the file will be shown to the user and the send will be cancelled.

 - Changed status bar updates in the Operating System Updater and Support Software to 
   match actual flash erase times and discover times (rather than using estimates as 
   before).

 - The Chart View and all Timelines are now hidden when less than two records have 
   been synchronised.

 - The Map View is now hidden when no records or zones with GPS coordinates have been 
   synchronised.

 - Now creating two log files in the AppData folder.

     application.log contains error messages from the Firmware Updater or the main 
     HydroSense II software since the application was started.

     bluetooth.log contains full transaction details for the last bluetooth session. 
     This can be used to diagnose connection problems.

   These logs are intended to be used by Campbell Scientific technicians to solve 
   software issues.

 - Added a link to the logs folder in the Firmware Updater, this allows the user easy 
   access to the folder for sending reports to Campbell Scientific.

 - Added a link to the logs directory to the application menu in the Support Software 
   main window.

 - Added the software version number to the title bar of the Operating System Updater.

v1.0.2.177 : Released 5 Oct 2011

 - Fixed an issue where computers running Windows XP and using the Widcomm Bluetooth
   stack would not detect the Bluetooth stack correctly.

 - Fixed an issue in the Timeline control where deleting measurements from the 
   beginning or end of a data set would cause the Timeline to become unresponsive. 
   The issue would resolve itself after a program restart. This fix has removed the 
   issue completely.

 - Resized images in the help file to suit 800x600 screens.

 - Changed the program version tooltip at the bottom of the main screen to include 
   the day this version was released.

 - Pressing delete while having points selected in the Data View now removes the 
   selected points.

 - Added a confirmation dialog before removing points from the Data View.

 - Added a caching system for the Data View, this should provide a small improvement 
   to performance when changing the date filter via the Timeline.

 - Now saving the size of the main screen between program starts.

 - Fixed a typo in the Edit Zone Window, 'center' has been changed to 'centre'.

 - Changes to the layout of the help file to match the software manual.

 - Small cosmetic changes to the scrollbar underneath the timeline to fit in with 
   other scrollbars in the software.

______________________________________________________________________________________

v1.0.1.169 : Released 1 Sept 2011

 - Moved to a new versioning system. Hydrosoft versions are now of the format: 
   Major.Minor.Build.Revision where Major, Minor and Build numbers are 
   autoincremented and the Revision number specifies the source control revision 
   number.

 - The HydroSense II Support Software entry in Add/Remove programs now uses the 
   HydroSoft icon.

 - Devices with data saved to disk will now appear in the device list when no 
   Bluetooth hardware is present.

 - The last device selected will be saved on exit so that the next time the software 
   starts, this device will be selected again (rather than defaulting to the first 
   device in the list).

 - Fixed an issue where the following would occur:

     - Connect to a device and synchronise
     - Store a new datapoint on the device without 
       disconnecting the software
     - Press the Sync button in the software
     - This sync will fail and will need to be retried a 
       second time.

 - Removed erroneous lines at the edges of the Chart View when Show All Dates 
   is selected.

 - Fixed an issue where the application would crash if a large date range of data was 
   about to be displayed. This could occur if the clock is not set properly on the 
   Hydrosense II, resulting in data from 1/1/2000 to the current date. These changes
   will allow date ranges of any size.

 - Small changes to the datestamps shown at the bottom of the timeline charts to make 
   the date they are indicating more obvious (e.g. "4.33pm" -> "4.33pm, 30 Aug" and 
   "30 Aug" -> "30 Aug 11")

 - Now hiding the main data list and displaying a progress spinner when the list is
   being updated. Large amounts of data (>500 points) would cause this list to become 
   unresponsive if visible during the update.

 - Fixed a cosmetic bug where the scrollbar for the main data list would be half drawn 
   when large amounts of data (>500 points) are displayed in the list.

 - Fixed a bug where zooming any of the three timeline charts to the maximum zoom 
   level would cause the application to become unresponsive.

 - Changed the TimeChart export images to use the system date format for the x-axis 
   timestamps, so these will update correctly for U.S. machines.

 - Fixed a display issue where the timeline view width would be reported as 0 hours 
   if the width was less than an hour. This will now read X minutes.
