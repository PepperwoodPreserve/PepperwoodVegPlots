Abstract:
We installed fifty 20x20 m plots stratified across woodland and forest vegetation at Pepperwood Preserve, Sonoma Co. California. Plot locations were stratified across deciduous vs. evergreen woodland, elevation, slope, aspect and topographic position (high and low on hillslopes). Plots were placed on relatively homogeneous slope and aspect, so ridgetops and drainages were avoided. All saplings > 50 cm tall and all trees > 1 cm dbh were mapped, tagged and measured (height in saplings, dbh in trees). Seedlings (height of 1-10 cm)   and juveniles (height of 11-49 cm) were counted.

Spatial data:
Plot locations were recorded with GPS set to UTM zone 10. Locations refer to the SW corner of each plot. Plot edges were aligned N-S and E-W, starting from this corner point.

Projection:
"WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_10N"

Data columns:
ID - plot ID number
UTM.E - UTM easting coordinate
UTM.N - UTM northing coordinate
Slope - slope (°) measured in field with clinometer
Aspect - aspect (°) measured in field with compass
Total.basal.area_cm2 - total basal area of all trees, in cm2
Basal area (cm2) of twenty species recorded across all plots

(1) There appear to be hybrids of Quercus agrifolia and Q. kelloggii. Most were recorded as Q. agrifolia, but in at least one case this code was used to indicate we are not sure of identity
(2) Field work for this project started in February, 2013, before the white oaks leafed out. Blue oak and Oregon oak cannot be distinguished without leaves, and are indicated here as QUEDEC pending additional field work to do identification. We also believe there may be hybridization going on in this landscape, and plan morphometric and genetic analysis in the future to investigate this further.
